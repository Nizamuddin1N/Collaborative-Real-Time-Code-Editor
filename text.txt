process is a global object that represents the current Node.js runtime process (your running program).
You can access it anywhere without importing anything.
It provides information and methods to control the program, e.g. environment variables (process.env), command-line arguments (process.argv), current working directory, etc.

dotenv.config() is what actually loads the variables from your .env file into process.env so you can use them inside your Node.js app.
